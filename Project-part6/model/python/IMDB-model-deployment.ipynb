    "## Step 3: Putting our model to work\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've mentioned a few times now, our goal is to have our model deployed and then access it using a very simple web app. The intent is for this web app to take some user submitted data (a review), send it off to our endpoint (the model) and then display the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a small catch. Currently the only way we can access the endpoint to send it data is using the SageMaker API. We can, if we wish, expose the actual URL that our model's endpoint is receiving data from, however, if we just send it data ourselves we will not get anything in return. This is because the endpoint created by SageMaker requires the entity accessing it have the correct permissions. So, we would need to somehow authenticate our web app with AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a website that authenticates to AWS seems a bit beyond the scope of this course so we will opt for an alternative approach. Namely, we will create a new endpoint which does not require authentication and which acts as a proxy for the SageMaker endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additional constraint, we will try to avoid doing any data processing in the web app itself. Remember that when we constructed and tested our model we started with a movie review, then we simplified it by removing any html formatting and punctuation, then we constructed a bag of words embedding and the resulting vector is what we sent to our model. All of this needs to be done to our user input as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately we can do all of this data processing in the backend, using Amazon's Lambda service.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Web App Diagram.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which will be deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's feature data, sends it off and expects a buy or not buy in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. This Python function will do the data processing we need to perform on a user submitted review. In addition, we will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.![Web App Diagram.svg](attachment:Web App Diagram.svg)"
